				<p>"Ol' Blue Eyes", is what they call him.</p>
				<p>Nicknamed "Ol Blue Eyes" for his bright blue eyes, Frank Albert Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey on December 12, 1915 and passed away on May 14, 1998, which means he was 82 when he died. Sinatra is one of the most popular american singers of the mid-20th century and is one of the world's best-selling music artists, having sold an estimate of around 150 million records.</p>
				<p>He has popularized a ton of the old-school music you may know and love up until today, with some of his more mainstream songs being "My Way", "Fly Me to the Moon", "Over and Over", and so on. (He didn't technically write these songs, though he did popularize them, so.) </p>
				<p>Frank Sinatra had a really unique singing style, having a deep and calming echo in his voice. </p>
